My friends really want to work on something seriously. But they don't have a solid idea, they are saddened by the ideas they come up with. This is an oppurtuinity for me to form an project that gets them excited to work.
The other day they tried brain storming ideas, the results weren't good.
One was a tattoo printed hand sock.
Logo creation with Image Generation techniques.
Etc..
All these ideas are something that anyone can do. If you gonna do a startup, doing a harder one is much easier. You can get more people excited for the harder ones. There is lesser competition for harder ones too.
We could start a Anduril in India. The thing with defence is, it's very clear we need more advance equipment for surveillance, data collection etc.. 
Also maybe in the process of building this stuff, we will find something that is applicable for many enterprises, and sell it to them. Gotta think seriously about this idea. 
For this to work, One needs to start with a problem statement from the government. And increase capabilities and build large scale products.

Palmer Lucky who started Anduril is a very fascinating guy. He started Oculus when he was 19 and sold it to meta. Interesting this is he bought bitcoin in *2010* that's crazy.
Very inspiring fellow I would say. Also it reinforces what I was thinking about putting my work out there and understanding people.

What are the PROBLEMS need to be SOLVED
robotics, all the time everywhere
