Why you need to start writing.

The answer for me is "Clarity of Thought".
I have struggled in expressing my thoughts properly. 
Writing helps me think through stuff and I like it a lot.

I want to build a personal brand with my writing.
So the writing would be as interesting as curious of a life I live. 
An aim to build 1000 true followers.

Some real world examples of,
People finding great oppurtunities cause of their writing.

Legendary Investor "Bill Gurley" when asked why he writes:

	I learned that the broader my distribution was, the more power came back to me to your point.
	
	And then later, I think in venture capital, I learned that having a reputation as a thought leader was very helpful in closing the deal. And so, the reputational benefit access, we talked about being able to sit down with geniuses and talk to them, getting that access is partially tied to reputation.
	
	And so that's another benefit. Along the way, somewhere, I learned that I just think better when I write. You've heard this from others, but putting things down in a structured way and having to defend an argument. And it ties back into Bezos’ 6-page letter kind of thing like it just causes you to think better.
	
	There are some consequences, you write everything down, you're going to get some stuff wrong and then people 15 years later, say, see. So that comes with it. And then as I've gotten older, the giving back part is really, really rewarding. If someone comes up to you and says, hey, that really helped change my life, my direction. That's pretty powerful

	I think the three that really stand out to me are this rigor and clarity of thought, this hunger, appetite, willfulness, determination, and this … warmth and desire to make people around them better off. Those are three that really stand out to me.
