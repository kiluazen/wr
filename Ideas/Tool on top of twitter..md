I was listening first million podcast with Jason Cohen.
He was talking about how we uses twitter.
This would be a good tool for me to work.
Some things it will do
- It will do a similarity thing between your interests and some peoples tweet. And it will notify you about it as soon as they tweet. So that you can reply and be seen by the people you admire.
- Also a dm tool that dm's every new one that follows you helping you grow your users.
- It could just be a browser extension in the beginning.
