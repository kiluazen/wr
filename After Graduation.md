I recently got an offer by my internship to continue this after graduation full time.

I don't have a plan on what to do after my graduation.

The things that I am working on here are prompt engineering mostly, which is not that exciting.
I mean I have great knowledge of linear algebra, information retrieval, diffusion models etc.. I should try to find a more attractive and inspiring job.

I might be under-estimating myself in terms of my capabilities. 

Also the thing is I don't wanna stay at home after my graduation, I wanna live on my own. So yeah, that could be a tempting reason why I would continue at Elzo.

Things I can do:
- Start re-applying to all those jobs, since you have a far better resume now!!
- You can apply to IISC professor's NLP lab that could lead to some interesting work.

Meanwhile please work on more and more side projects.

I been working on django and other things recently.
