I would say my biggest insecurity is not achieving anything meaningful in life.
This title is from the '7 Years' song by Lukas Graham. I was listening to it the other day and decided to write this. I am about to graduate in a month, ( 21 years old as of 2024 ).

It's going to be a crazy decade ahead.
I was listening to the [# Farza Majeed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/farza-majeed-76685612a/overlay/about-this-profile/) the founder of buildspace talking about his journey. Learning about people who built great products, it's clear that they built many side projects. Out of which one of them took off, giving them some success/revenue. At every stage, they up their game, and also get better at picking ideas.

When she was asked how she got cast (Video Timestamp: [3.50][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQbDUisfQ2k&ab_channel=BBCRadio1] ), she said "I always treated my music videos as my acting portfolio, So I'd write characters and play them", Chad the director saw her videos and noticed her doing some fight moves in one of the videos and reached out, She screams "it worked!" in the interview.  
That's how I am gonna treat my side projects and the writing. They are a portfolio, it's me showing the world what I have done and what I am capable of.

I feel ashamed hearing people talk about them working on side projects at 14.., being in my final year I haven't worked on many side projects, and the few I have started I haven't finished. I started programming in my second year. Right now I am working on a tool that would help you write better coldEmails, I want to get this shipped. I realize the importance of finishing things.

IN 5 years.
I really wish to be in San Francisco, but I don't see a plausible way other than doing MS. Which would put me in a lot of debt, Debt is okay if I am willing to work at big tech for some years but I wanna start my own thing. Hopefully, at least I'll visit SF and be inspired by the Aura of Silicon Valley.

IN 2 years.
This is a much more of a defined problem. And every active decision I make now will influence that.
Along with my job, I want to as I said work on side projects. Brainstorming project ideas has been hard, hearing my ColdEmail idea must have outed that earlier.
I want to take my writing seriously. One thing I know is: that I love writing, the feeling I get when I write is a flow of state where I am talking to myself and all along just writing it. I love writing on paper. But procrastination and obligations have made me inconsistent with writing and I am gonna change that.
Be disciplined and put something out every week, similar to how you disciplined yourself into working out every day.
Speaking of the gym, I expect to be in good shape by next year.
I've been going to the gym for the past 1.5 years, with a couple of months of exception in between. The effectiveness has been an e^x so far, i.e. last month was the most effective I have ever been, I understand what to do and how to do more. My life has changed significantly since the last 1 year of gym, lost some weight, got me out of a low period in my life, made me feel better about myself, etc.

I also want to date, I have a lot to learn from dating. I had my first relationship that lasted a few months. Some learnings from that are.
She told me I was insensitive. I realize that I was trying to be a stoic and carefree guy which actually came off as insensitive and non empathetic which I don't think I am. I know in the back of my head like be yourself etc. But somehow I faked some aspects which I didn't realize at the time. 
I always used have this monologue in me that said, you should have said that when she asked this etc.. I guess the short answer is Communication.

When we used to discuss typical Indian problems with parents. I used to dismiss them which were related to communication and obligations to parents, the guarantee that her parents are gonna marry her off by 26. But in honesty, these are the problems I'll face too, for some reason, I behaved as if I am above them. Once my mother was talking about how she would get me married by this age, I got so frustrated cause it angers me to think someone was making my decisions. 
I realize many things I could have said to her, I'll compile them to a letter and send it to her.

With all this aside, one of my great ambitions is to start a company. What better way to get rich and create value right!!

I hope one of my side projects will lead me to this, or the people I'll meet in Bengaluru will lead me to this. From my side, I want my writing, reading, side projects, and my physical presence in Bengaluru to provide me the surface area for luck.

Meeting New people has always been an issue, How do you make friends. So far friends just happened to me by the virtue of group projects, presentations etc.. But that's not how it's gonna be in real world. I should get better at cold Emailing people I admire and try to make friends with some of them. Sounds Easy but still struggle to do that.

Overall mostly optimistic about what's about to come. Hopefully, I stay productive and enjoy the process.

Peace!!
