Just got off call with my mom.
Apparently my cousin brother Harish made a comment on the failure of digging the bore for Malmama.
He said he's been spending money left and right with this pre-wedding and car driving and I see my mama struggling with finances.
I wanted to articulate my philosophy around it on phone. But I couldn't because my philosophy was accumulated from books i have read and some tweets. Decide but my understanding of this to words, question myself well. There you go my new writing exercise.
