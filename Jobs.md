| Imbue                      | *Why are you interested in Imbue? (optional)*<br><br>I saw a podcast with the founder Kanjun. Got fascinated by the work done by Imbue.<br>There are some great people working here. Doing great work in reasoning. <br>It would be extra-ordinary oppurtunity to learn and contribute.<br><br>*What specifically interests you about this role and what are your main motivations to excel in it? How might this opportunity align with your long-term career goals?*<br><br>I'm excited for several reasons<br>- Firstly to work at a startup pace, a chance to learn on an exponential curve is what I want.<br>- Work on the fascinating, ever evolving field of AI and make useful products around it.<br>- To work with people in the top of their fields, and in Silicon Valley that is every ambitious persons dream. |         |
| Terra                      | Hi , I'm Kushal.<br>Love the product you guys are building.<br>I personally built apis for my RAG pipeline in my previous intern. I have done research work in GNNs and diffusion models, Worked with LLM, writing probabilistic software is something I have done for a year now.<br>Also, I am a personal health geek; I collect as much data as possible about my body. I weight lift, so tracking helps see my progress with my training. Building something I would use daily is an exciting prospect pushing your work.<br>Please check out my profile and let me know what you think.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |         |
